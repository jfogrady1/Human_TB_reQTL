# Human_TB_reQTL

# Summary
Understanding the functional impact of variants is critical for discerning the host response during tuberculosis (TB) disease, and anti-TB treatment. Hitherto, there have been no genome-wide in vivo response expression quantitative trait loci (re-QTLs) in the context of active-TB and anti-TB treatment. Here, we exploit longitudinal whole-blood RNA-seq data from n = 48 patients with active-TB who underwent anti-TB treatment and call variants from these transcriptomics data. We highlight substantial differences in the transcriptome profile following anti-TB treatment with thousands of genes differentially expressed. Associating our imputed variants to the expression of nearby genes, we characterise thousands of cis-eQTLs and hundreds of re-QTLs. We further show significant changes in cell-type proportions during anti-TB treatment through in silico deconvolution and highlight the cell-type specific nature of cis-eQTLs. Our work highlights the immunobiology of active-TB and anti-TB treatment while also providing a framework for other studies that are limited to RNA-seq data.
